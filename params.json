Read his story.  \r\n* [__data__](data) folder contains all files that will be loaded into the ESP8266 flash memory SPIFF drive to contain website data (folder must use this name for Arduino IDE to automatically upload to ESP8266)\r\n* [__3dprint__](3dprint) folder contains all CAD files plus derivative 3D print files\r\n* [__ufo.ino__](ufo.ino) is the Arduino IDE main program: requires Arduino IDE 1.6.7+ plus additional modules. see ufo.ino source file for more details about requirements\r\n* [__nodejs testserver__](nodejs testserver) contains source files to simulate the ESP8266 webserver for testing purposes; requires nodejs server + static-server module\r\n* [__partlist__](partlist/readme.md#ufo-partlist)\r\n \r\n\r\n###Example use-case at Dynatrace Ruxit\r\nCares about visualizing the actual continuous delivery pipeline, from developers commit to the build system, all the way to deployments into staging systems. The UFO visualizes two pipeline stages, and for each it uses different color/animation coding to represent state and severity.\r\n![ufo banner](https://raw.github.com/Dynatrace/ufo/master/Pipeline-State-Lamp-01.png)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
